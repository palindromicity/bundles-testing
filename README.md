# bundles-testing

Bundles testing is a project for testing the basic functionality of the bundle-lib and bundles.
The idea is that we have an integration test module (bundles-test-integration), that deplends on the interface module
(bundles-test-integration) but not the implementation.

The interface is attributed with `@IndexSubclasses`, from the ClassIndex system.  Any implementing classes
will be exposed through the bundle system.

The implementation (bundles-test-implementation) is packaged as a bundle (bundles-test-bundle).

The integration test loads the implementation through the bundle system, by interface, and executes its methods.
The demonstrates the main use case.

> NOTE: the code for the implementation and bundle are provided, but

> the bundle produced is in the test/resources directory of the integration project

> If you want to modify you need to build with your changes, and replace the bundle file in the test/resources location.
